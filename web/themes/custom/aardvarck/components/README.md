## Atomic Design Structure

### Atoms

The smallest, indivisible elements that serve as the building blocks of the design system.
Examples: button, icon, input field, label, logo, ...

## Molecules

Simple groups of atoms functioning together as a single component.
Examples: card, contact-info, form field group, ...

## Organisms

Complex UI sections composed of multiple molecules (and sometimes atoms).
Examples: main-navigation, language-switcher, ...

## Templates

Page-level layouts that define structure and hierarchy but use placeholder content.
Examples: page layout, article layout, product page template.

## Pages

Real content applied to templates — the final, concrete representation of the UI.
Examples: homepage, contact page, blog article.
